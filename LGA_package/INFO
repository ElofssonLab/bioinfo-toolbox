LGA package
-----------

NOTE: recommended settings: ulimit -s unlimited 
      or for example (.cshrc sun): limit stacksize 32768
      or for example (.profile apple): ulimit -s 32768

The package contains the latest version of the LGA program (Linux, SunOS, and Apple executables).

To calculate structural superpositions between two structures the user can select
several different options (for details please check README.lga and "run_examples" files).

In general, lga can perform calculations in two different modes:
1. Fixed residue-residue correspondence (options: -1, -2, -3). For example: -3 -sda
2. Search for residue-residue correspondence (option: -4). For example: -4 -sia

IMPORTANT: the options "-1, -2, -3" do NOT calculate structure based alignment.
With these options the user can calculate structure superpositions for a *given*
(fixed) residue-residue correspondence.
NOTE: the desired residue-residue correspondence can be defined
using options like: -sda, -ch1:A, -aa1:n1:n2, -er1:s1:s2, -al, ...
NOTE: the option -sda can be used if two protein structures overlap by the
numbering of amino acids. The chain IDs can be specified using parameters, e.g.:
-ch1:A -ch2:B.

IMPORTANT: If the user needs to find structure alignment (automatically establish
the residue-residue correspondence), then the option "-4" has to be used.

To run LGA calculations the user can use a perl script:
  runlga.mol_mol.pl <mol1> <mol2> <parameters>
where <mol1> and <mol2> are the filenames of structures that have
to be superimposed, and <parameters> are selected options.

IMPORTANT: The second structure <mol2> in the command line serves as a frame
of reference for the comparison of two structures. Briefly saying, LGA program
calculates the number of residues from the model (<mol1> - first structure)
that are close enough (under the distance cutoffs) to the corresponding residues
from the target (<mol2> - second structure).

For a given target for the purpose of structure similarity searches in PDB and for
ordering models (templates) by the level of similarity to the target, it is recomended
the target is used as frame of reference (<mol2> - second structure). This way the
calculated results from "<mol1>.<mol2>" comparisons can be sorted by the number of
superimposed residues N (under one selected DIST cutoff), or by GDT_TS (average from
four distance cutoffs), or LGA_S (weighted results from the full set of distance
cutoffs) values.

To run multiple LGA calculations the user can use a perl script:
  runlga.list_list.pl <list1> <list2> <parameters>
where <list1> and <list2> are the lists of structures that have
to be superimposed, and <parameters> are the selected options.
For example in order to compare several NMR models a user can 
proceed as follows (see run_examples):
1) copy pdb NMR structures to the subdirectory PDB_local (e.g. pdbnzzz.ent)
2) create list1 e.g.:
nzzz___1
nzzz___2
nzzz___3
nzzz___4
nzzz___5
3) create list2 e.g.:
nzzz___1
4) run script e.g.: runlga.list_list.pl list1 list2 -3 -sda

NOTE: Specifying NMR MODEL please use the following notation:
  1bve_B_5   for PDB entry: 1bve, chain: 'B', model: 5
  1awo___7   for PDB entry: 1awo, chain: ' ', model: 7

IMPORTANT: GDT_TS values are calculated with the option -3 only. GDT_TS value serves
as a good structure similarity estimator, but the user should remember that the
option "-3 -sda" can be used only when the residue-residue correspondences between 
compared structures are known (e.g. comparing different models of the same protein 
when the models have the same residue numbering and chain ID).

The experiments show that LGA_S is slightly more sensitive and accurate in scoring
structural similarity than GDT_TS, and it can be used to evaluate the level of
structure similarity between proteins in both modes: -3 (LGA_S3) and -4 (LGA_S).

The range of LGA_S is from 0.0% to 100.0%. It is important
to remember that in LGA calculations the <mol2> (second structure) serves
as a frame of reference. It means that if for example <mol1> is 50 residue
long and <mol2> is 100 residue long then the maximum possible value
of LGA_S could be 50% (a case when <mol1> is identical with the portion
of <mol2>), but if <mol1> is 100 residue long and <mol2> is 50 residue long
then the maximum value of LGA_S can be 100%.

The user may vary DIST (distance cutoff) to calculate more tight (accurate)
or more relaxed (to recognize overall similarity) superpositions.
The default: -d:5.0 (DIST=5 Angstroms).
