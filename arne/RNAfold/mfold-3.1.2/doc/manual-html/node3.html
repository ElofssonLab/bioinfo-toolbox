Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
RNA is ubiquitous in the cell and is important for many processes. The
activity of RNA is determined by its structure, the way it is folded
back on itself. Secondary structure modeling of RNA predicts, or
otherwise determines, the pattern of Watson-Crick (WC), wobble and
other, non-canonical pairings that occur when the RNA is folded.  For
the purposes of this article, a non-canonical base pair is defined as
non Watson-Crick (non W-C) and non-wobble (not GU or UG).  There are
many different kinds of RNA.  Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a crucial part
of the ribosome which is found in all living cells and in organelles
such as mitochondria and chloroplasts. Small nuclear RNAs (snRNA) form
a vital part of sliceosomes that process mRNAs in eukaryotes. These
are 2 examples of <EM>structural</EM> RNAs.

<P>
Messenger RNAs (mRNA) do more than just carry information. Secondary
structures can be used in part to explain translational controls in
mRNA [<A
 HREF="node19.html#MACP9001">1</A>,<A
 HREF="node19.html#SMIM9001">2</A>], and replication controls in
single-stranded RNA viruses [<A
 HREF="node19.html#MILD9001">3</A>]. Although the vast
majority of known mRNAs code for proteins or structural RNAs, some do
not [<A
 HREF="node19.html#BRAC9001">4</A>,<A
 HREF="node19.html#BROC9101">5</A>]; and it is likely that the secondary
structures of these transcripts play an important role in their
regulatory function in the cell. It is to be expected that many more
such functional RNAs will be discovered in the future.

<P>
RNA is not just a passive structural element or a regulator. It is
also an active component in many situations. Thus RNA acting alone is
able to catalyze RNA processing [<A
 HREF="node19.html#CECT8601">6</A>,<A
 HREF="node19.html#CECT9001">7</A>]. In a
protein-RNA complex, the RNA component of ribonuclease P is an active
component of tRNA processing [<A
 HREF="node19.html#DARS9201">8</A>]. 

<P>
The function of an RNA can only be understood in terms of its
secondary or tertiary structure. For the understanding of catalytic
activity, knowledge of secondary structure alone is insufficient.
However, few large structures have been determined by crystallography
[<A
 HREF="node19.html#KIMS7401">9</A>,<A
 HREF="node19.html#ROBJ7401">10</A>,<A
 HREF="node19.html#PLEH9401">11</A>] and the need for
modeling is great. Secondary structure modeling can reasonably be
viewed as a first step towards three dimensional modeling. For
example, in small and large subunit rRNA, all tertiary interactions,
including base triples, involve only 3% and 2% of the nucleotides,
respectively [<A
 HREF="node19.html#GUTR9501">12</A>]. In contrast, nucleotides in secondary
structure comprise 60% and 58% of these rRNAs.

<P>
Secondary structure modeling is therefore a significant first
step to the far more difficult process of three dimensional
atomic resolution modeling. Knowledge of secondary structure, together
with additional information on structural constraints or tertiary
interactions, can be used to construct atomic resolution structural
models [<A
 HREF="node19.html#MICF9001">13</A>,<A
 HREF="node19.html#MAJF9101">14</A>,<A
 HREF="node19.html#MAJF9301">15</A>].
