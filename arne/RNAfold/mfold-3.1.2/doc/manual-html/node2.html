Abstract</A>
</H1>

<P>
<IMG SRC="img/t.gif">
his article is about the current status of the <I>mfold</I> package for RNA
and DNA secondary structure prediction using nearest neighbor
thermodynamic rules. The details of the free energy rules and of the
latest version 3.0 software are described. Future plans are also
discussed.

<P>
The <I>mfold</I> software now runs on a variety of Unix platforms;
specifically SGI Irix, Sun Solaris, Dec alpha Ultrix and on
Linux. While the older interactive programs of version 2 still exist,
they are now run by a variety of scripts that make for much easier
handling. There is both a command line interface for <I>mfold</I> and
an HTML interface that runs in a Unix environment but can be accessed
by anyone with a web browser.

<P>
The thermodynamic basis for the folding model is presented in detail,
with references given for both specific free energy parameters and to
overview articles that have summarized the state of these nearest
neighbor parameters over the past dozen years. Both RNA and DNA rules
are discussed, with some mention of parameters for RNA/DNA
hybridization. Although the thermodynamic model has grown in
complexity to accommodate new types of information, the folding
algorithm has not yet incorporated some features, such as coaxial
stacking of adjacent helices, and other features will probably remain
too difficult or computationally expensive to implement. For this
reason, a new energy calculation program has been introduced to
recompute the free energies of predicted foldings to reflect the best
of our knowledge.

<P>
The most significant improvements in the <I>mfold</I> software are:
<DL COMPACT>
<FONT COLOR="#8B1A1A">
<DT>1.
<DD>Folding times have been greatly reduced in recent years, partly
because of faster computers and partly because of improvements in the
algorithm. 
<DT>2.
<DD>Folding constraints have been expanded and are now implemented
without the use of <I>bonus energies</I> that distort the results.
<DT>3.
<DD>The output is significantly improved. Clear and enlargeable
images of <I>dot plots</I> and of predicted foldings are now produced
in PostScript and <I>gif</I> formats. Bases in structures may be
annotated using different colors that reflect how <I>well-determined</I>
they are in terms of their tendency to pair with other bases or to be
single-stranded. Similarly, base pair probabilities from partition
function calculations may be used for annotation. A detailed
decomposition of each predicted folding into stacked pairs and loops
with associated free energies is now provided.
</DL>
</FONT>
<P>
The <I>mfold</I> software has a variety of parameters that may be
adjusted to improve the predictions.  Several examples are
presented to illustrate how to interpret folding results and how to
adjust these parameters to obtain better results.
