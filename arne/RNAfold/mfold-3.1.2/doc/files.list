    Suboptimal RNA/DNA folding package - M. Zuker and D. H. Turner

                             Version 3.0

Makefile - Standard UNIX makefile for RNA folding programs. 

auto_ct2ps - The script takes a .ct file, splits it into single structure
             files, and runs 'naview' and 'plt22ps' on each one to
             produce (multiple) PostScript files. Uses one of the .nav
             files copied from mfold-3.0/dat into $MFOLDLIB.

batgen - This program creates input files for RNA folding. (source is
         batgen.f) This is an obsolete program that is used directly
         with nafold. It has some bugs in it when complicated
         constraints are requested.

begin.dat - Displays program name and version.

begin2.dat - Displays author and reference information.

bpin.f - Source code for a subroutine used by 'distance'. 

bpsrch.f - Source code for a subroutine used by 'distance'.

ct_compare - This program compares one secondary structure with a 
             group of others. Similar to 'scorer'.

ct_compare.f - Source code for ct_compare.

ct2bp - Program that converts a ct file into the "Madison Format"
        See: http://bioinfo.math.rpi.edu/~zukerm/rna/formats.html#BP
        and
        http://bioinfo.math.rpi.edu/~zukerm/rna/Madison.html
        (source is ct2bp.f)

ct_gcg.f - This file contains an alternte for of the ct subroutine
           in misc.f . This alternate generates ct files that
           can be read directly by GCG software.

distance.f - This program reads a ct file containing between 2 and 15
             structures and computes the distance between the first
             and all the rest or else the distance between all pairs.

efn - An independent program to compute the energies of foldings
      using a ct file as input. This program requires energy table
      input. The output consists of the computed energy of each
      folding found in the input ct file. Text  output and/or
      energy detail output are options. (source is efn.f and efn.inc)

efn2 - Similar to efn, except that this program re-evaluates the
       free energies of foldings using more realistic rules: coaxial
       stacking of adjacent helices and Jacobson-Stockmeyer theory
       for multi-branch loops. Source in c++ directory.

errata3.list - List of errata found in version 3 folding programs  
               with dates.

filter-sort - A script that removes all helices containing fewer than
              $1 base pairs (default = 3 for segments > 100) from a 
              .plot file. No optimal helices are removed. The original 
              file is overwritten!

formid.f - Source code for formid. This subroutine reads and interprets
           sequence data.

getseq.f - Almost the same as formid.f. Used with batgen.

h-num - A script that takes a .plot file containing optimal and
        suboptimal helices and replaces the 'energy' value by
        the 'h-num' value. Records are sorted in order of increasing
        h-num, ie, from 'best-determined' to 'worst-determined'.
        Uses h-num.exe, which is created from h-num.f.

manual.ps - A somewhat updated version of :
            M. Zuker, D.H. Mathews and D.H. Turner
            Algorithms and Thermodynamics for RNA Secondary Structure 
            Prediction: A Practical Guide.
            In: RNA Biochemistry and Biotechnology, J. Barcisszewski
            and B.F.C. Clark, eds., NATO ASI Series
            Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1999.

manual-html - Directory containing an html version of manual.ps

mfold - This script runs "newtemp" to create energy tables (for
        version 2.3 rules only), and then runs nafold and other
        program to create the entire output.

misc.f - Miscellaneous subroutines for both the linear and circular
         versions of the folding program.

multid.f - This subroutine reads and interprets sequence data. It
           differs from formid in that it automatically returns
           one sequence after another to the calling routine instead
           of requesting a sequence number of identifier. 

naview - Program to read in a .ct file from a folding program and
         to create a device independent plot file (.plt2) for plotting
         the structure in the file. (source naview.c)
         Included with the permission of R.E. (Bob) Bruccoleri:
         An improved algorithm for nucleic acid secondary structure display. 
         R.E. Bruccoleri and G. Heinrich 
         Comput Appl Biosci 4: 167-73 (1988) 
         This program has been altered by M. Zuker and D. Stewart

newtemp - This program reads the 37° free energy files : asint1x2.dg, 
          asint2x3.dg, dangle.dg, loop.dg, miscloop.dg, sint2.dg, sint4.dg, 
          sint6.dg, stack.dg, tloop.dg, triloop.dg, tstackh.dg, tstacki.dg;
          as well as the correspondinf enthalpy files (.dh).
          It computes new energy files for folding at any
          user defined temperature between 0 and 100°.
          The output files are labelled with the appropriate
          temperature. For example, if 25°. is selected, the
          output energy files will be named: asint2x3.25, dangle.25, 
          loop.25, miscloop.25, sint2.25 etc. For DNA, the suffix would
          be '25d' instead of '25', and the input files would end with
          .dgd and .dhd instead of .dg and .dh, respectively.
          (source is newtemp.f)

plt22ps - This program creates PostScript output from naview plt2 files.
          (source is plt22ps.c & plt22gif_or_ps.h)

rna.f - Source code for important routines of nafold, the main
        program of mfold

rna.inc - An include file for rna.f

scorer - A program to count consevered helices between a reference folding
         and other (computed) foldings. Similar to ct_compare.

sort.f - Source code for the sorting subroutines of folding program.
         Used to sort base pairs from optimal to increasingly suboptimal
         for automatic traceback procedure.

sav2p-num - Takes a "sav" file and creates a p-num file (.ann)

sav2plot - Takes a "sav" file and creates a plot file (.plot)

                       Free Energy and Enthalpy Data

mfold version 3.0 uses new free energy rules. Unfortunately, they are
available only at 37° C. These data are stored in the following
files:

asint1x2.dat - free energies for 1x2 asymmetric interior loops
asint2x3.dat - free energies for 2x3 asymmetric interior loops
dangle.dat - single base stacking free energies
loop.dat - entropic component for internal, bulge and hairpin loops.
miscloop.dat - Miscellaneous loop file. Contains :
               1. Extrapolation for large loops based on polymer theory
               2. Asymmetric internal loop correction parameters.
               3. Paremeters for multibranch loops
               4. Paremeters for multibranch loops (for efn2 only)
               5. Terminal AU or GU penalty
               6. Bonus for GGG hairpin
               7. C hairpin rules: a) slope  b) intercept c) value for size 3
               8. Intermolecular initiation free energy
               9. GAIL Rule (Grossly Asymmetric Interior Loop Rule) (on or off)
sint2.dat - free energies for 1x1 symmetric interior loops
sint4.dat - free energies for 2x2 symmetric interior loops
sint6.dat - free energies for 3x3 symmetric interior loops
stack.dat - free energies for base pair stacking
tloop.dat - free energies for distinguished tetraloops
triloop.dat - free energies for distinguished triloops
tstackh.dat - free energies for terminal mismatch stacking in hairpin loops
tstacki.dat - free energies for terminal mismatch stacking in internal loops

Of these, asint1x2.dat, asint2x3.dat, sint2.dat, sint4.dat, sint6.dat and
triloop.dat are new to version 3.0. The tloop.dat file now contains
information on the closing base pair, and the miscloop.dat file has
been expanded. Both asint2x3.dat and sint6.dat are not used since at
present we do not have sufficient data for them. 

Because the energy "dat" files are available only at 37° C, we have
retained the version 2.3 rules for folding both DNA and RNA at
arbitrary temperatures. The version 2.3 data are stored in energy
files with suffixes "dg" (free energies at 37°) and "dh"
(enthalpies; assumed constant over the range 0-100°). The "newtemp"
program works with these files. When the mfold script is used, the
version 3.0 rules will be used by default for folding RNA, as long as
the entry 'T=37' DOES NOT appear on the command line. If 'T=37'
appears on the command line, then version 2.3 rules will be used. Of
course, when DNA is folded, or when a temperature other than 37° is
requested, version 2.3 rules will be used.
