             Version 2.1 was created in September 1992. 

1. The route to a "hard copy" energy dot plot has been changed. The
format of the ASCII plot file has been improved. This file can be
produced by running lrna or crna and choosing the plot option from
the popup menu in "dot plot" mode, or by running the new
"sav2plot" program using an existing save file. This
ASCII plot file is processed into a color Postscript file by the
dot2ps shell script (which itself uses the dotps C program). Thus
the "figdot" program and the need to use the GCG "figure" program
have both been eliminated.


2. Conversion to IRIX 4.0.5 created a problem with the interactive
energy dot plot. The dolab2.c subroutine used to draw "fancy font"
labelling in the dot plot refused to interface with the rest of the
FORTRAN code. This subroutine was eliminated and replaced by a few
simple lines of code within dotplot.f


3. Programs "scorer" (by John Jaeger) and "ct_compare" (by M. Zuker) 
have been added. These compare a given RNA secondary structure, from 
an input ct file, with a group of other structures on the same 
sequence fragment, taken from a second input ct file. Scorer is 
"helix" based, while ct_compare counts both conserved helices and 
base pairs.

4. A manual describing use of the UNIX versions has been created and 
placed in the doc directory as "manuscript.ps". This document is in 
Postscript. The files figure-4.ps and figure-5.ps are part of the 
manual.

             Version 2.2 was created in December  1992.

5.  The *.dat and *.dh files now reside in their own directory. The
relative path is mfold-2.2/dat. The file 'path.inc' in mfold-2.2/src
defines this path in a data statement. This should be edited before 
program installation. Makefile should also be edited so the BINDIR 
and LIBDIR are properly defined.

This path is needed by the programs : crna,efn,lrna and newtemp.
source code 'newtemp.f'. This is an absolute path; on my IRIS it is:

'/usr/people/zuker/mfold-2.2/dat/'. In the export version this is:
'/usr/local/lib/mfold/dat/'.

This should be changed according to the wishes of your users. Note
that lrna, crna and efn newtemp concatenate 'path' and the .dat file
names. If the openfile fails, the programs look in the current
working directory. The 'newtemp' program assumes that the .dat and 
.dh files are in the 'path' directory. The new files for folding at 
different temperatures are written into the current working 
directory. Thus a user can create files for folding at (say) 45 
degrees. He/she must then type in 'stack.045', 'loop.045' and so on 
when prompted.
