D.H. Mathews & M. Zuker 
Coaxial stacking of helixes enhances binding of oligoribonucleotides 
and improves predictions of RNA folding. 
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91, 9218-9222 (1994) 

Coaxial stacking of adjacent helices is not yet included.

2. The instructions in mfold-2.3/doc/manual.ps
(http://www.ibc.wustl.edu/~zuker/seqanal/) are for versions 2.0-2.2
and are somewhat out-of-date. They still accurately describe the
interactive folding of a sequence and the use of the interactive dot
plot. For those with a Silicon Graphics workstation, the interactive
dot plot feature can be used. 

Version 2.3 introduces the command 'mfold'. The usage is:

mfold SEQ=file_name' 
[ NA=RNA (default) or DNA ] [ LC=sequence type (default = linear)]
[ T=temperature (default = 37°) ] [ P=percent (default = 5) ]
[ W=window parameter (default - set by sequence length)
[ MAX=maximum number of foldings to be computed (default 100) ]
[ START=5' base # (default = 1) [ STOP=3' base # (default = end)

where all entries in square brackets are optional. The default values are:

NA=RNA       (Nucleic Acid is RNA or DNA)
              -       -       ---
LC=linear    (Linear or Circular nucleic acid)
              -         -
T=37         (Temperature is 37° by default)
              -
P=5          (Percent suboptimality is 5% by default)
              -
W=           (Window parameter is set by the script if not set by the user)
              -
MAX=100      (MAXimum number of foldings to be computed - 100 by default)
              ---
START=1      (STARTing base of sequence - 1 by default)
              -----
STOP=9999    (STOPping base of sequence - end of sequence by default)
              ----

There is also the script mfold-html which produces almost the same
output as well as an html file for viewing the output. See
mfold-2.3/samples for 2 examples. The 'alu' example was generated by:

mfold-html SEQ=alu.seq P=10 W=5

and the 'pstv' example by

mfold-html SEQ=pstv.seq P=10 W=10 LC=circular
