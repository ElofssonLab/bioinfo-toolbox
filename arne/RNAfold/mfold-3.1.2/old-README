         - Prediction of RNA/DNA secondary structure by free energy 
           minimization.
         - Version 2.3
         - Michael Zuker and Doug Turner
         - C++ version by David Mathews
       
Read INSTALL for installation instructions, and the version-2.3 file
for valuable information.  Look also in the doc directory.

The original version (1.0) was designed by Michael Zuker and
programmed by Eric Nelson in the summer of 1987 in the Division of
Biological Sciences at the National Research Council of Canada. John
Jaeger, a graduate student with Doug Turner, added the tetraloop bonus
energy feature and created the BATGEN program for batch file generation.
       
Version 2.3 brings the RNA energy parameters up-to-date with those
published by Walter et al., 1994 (below), and introduces DNA folding
for the first time using the parameters of John SantaLucia (below).
Previous versions called upon the user to run various program
interactively. This can still be done, but foldings can now be
generated more automatically with a single command line. For example,
the command:

mfold SEQ=test.seq T=25 P=6 START=51

will fold the sequence stored in 'test.seq' at 25° C starting with
the 51st base and will produce optimal and suboptimal foldings within
6% of the computed minimum free energy. Foldings are drawn using the
'naview' program. (R.E. Bruccoleri & G. Heinrich, An improved algorithm
for nucleic acid secondary structure display. Comput Appl Biosci 4:
167-73, 1988.)

METHOD : A dynamic programming algorithm is used to find optimal and
suboptimal foldings of an RNA/DNA molecule starting from linear sequence
data. Auxiliary information can be used to constrain the folding.
