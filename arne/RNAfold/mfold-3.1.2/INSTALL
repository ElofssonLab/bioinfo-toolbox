                       INSTALLATION of mfold 3.1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. The makefile
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file, "Makefile", contains instructions for compiling the
programs.  The first portion of "Makefile" must be edited. A number of
parameters should be set.

1. FFLAGS: This must be set. At the least, the Fortran compiler must
be able to accept lines longer that the standard 80 columns, and a
"static" option must be selected so that variables do not change
in functions or subroutines between calls. A number of options have
been made available, including one for "Gnu Fortran", g77. The level
of optimization should be as high as possible.

2. CFLAGS: Choose the highest level of optimization that works.

3. FTN, CC and C++: Define the Fortran, C and C++ compilers,
respectively. For example, 'CC' could be gcc (Gnu C), or 'C++' could
be C++.

4. INCL and BITS: These must be defined together. Use the first option
if your Fortran compiler has "iibset" and "iibits" for storing or
retrieving single bits in 16 bit (short) integers. The "gnu" version
will work anywhere, but it is slightly less efficient.

5. BINDIR and LIBDIR: These are optional. If defined, BINDIR is where
the binaries and scripts will be copied, and LIBDIR is where the
energy files, images, and other data will be copied.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B. Environment variables and Path
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Define MFOLDLIB to point to LIBDIR as defined in "Makefile". 
   If the command

make install

is not issued, then LIBDIR is not used. In this case, MFOLDLIB should
point to the 'dat' subdirectory of where the mfold package is stored.

2. Make sure that all binaries are on your path. If you wish, you can
   define an environment variable, MFOLD, that points to where the
   mfold package is stored. In this case, you should add $MFOLD/bin
   to your path. This can be accompished (for example) by adding:

export PATH=$MFOLD/bin:$PATH

to your $HOME/.profile file, or to the system /etc/profile file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
C. Compilation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming that you have not downloaded ready-to-run binaries, you must
compile the programs in the package.

In general, the command:

make all

will create all binaries and place them in the bin subdirectory. You may
individual programs if you wish.

The command:

make install

will do the same and will then strip the binaries and copy them into
BINDIR as defined in Makefile. If you set FFLAGS to create statically
linked binaries, then you should remove the "strip" statement from
"Makefile". 

The command:

make clean

will perform a cleanup by erasing object modules and binaries in
the bin subdirectory.

Please report bugs, other problems or suggestions to zukerm@rpi.edu
Look at the files in the "doc" directory, especially the manual, which
is in PostScript, pdf and HTML form.
