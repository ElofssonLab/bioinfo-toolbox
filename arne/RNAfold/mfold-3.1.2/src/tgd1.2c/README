Release tgd1.2c.  Fixed polygon and filledpolygon bugs
thanks to notes from Ronan Waide (waider@cork.cig.mot.com).

--------------------------

February 9, 1996

Release tgd1.2b.  Special filename stdout can now be used
in commands gif and gd.  Use of stdout results in tgd
output going to standard out instead of to a disk file.
Suggested by Nathan J Kurz <nate@tripod.tripod.com>.

Release tgd1.2a.  Received a complaint that tgdsamfont.c
couldn't be assembled (assembler out of memory) so I
decomposed the file into several files (tgdFont*.c).
No functional changes. --bks

Hi,

This release is tgd1.2, issued to correspond
to the latest release of gd1.2.
Documentation is in tgd1.2/docs/tgd.html.
Latest documentation should be at:
  http://s27w007.pswfs.gov/tgd/

The gd 1.2 distribution is in tgd1.2/gd1.2
To make tgd, try 
   % cd tgd1.2
   % make

This should make both the gd graphics library (tgd0/gd1.1.1/libgd.a)
and the program tgd.  However, fiddling may be necessary as this
is only tested on SunOS 4.x.

Please free to drop me a line:
   bks@s27w007.pswfs.gov
or
   bks@netcom.com

If I haven't given you credit, let me know immediately
so that I can correct the credits section of the document
at http://s27w007.pswfs.gov/tgd/.
