ID   Adaptive immunity.
AC   KW-1064
DE   Protein involved in adaptive immunity. Vertebrates can develop a broad
DE   and almost infinite repertoire of antigen-specific receptors, which
DE   allows vertebrates to recognize almost any potential pathogen or toxin
DE   and to mount antigen-specific responses to it. Two types of adaptive
DE   immunity systems have evolved in vertebrates in order to generate
DE   immune receptor diversity. The jawed vertebrates strategy uses the
DE   V(D)JC recombination to achieve combinatorial diversity of
DE   immunoglobulin-based B cell receptors and T cell receptors. The
DE   jawless vertebrate strategy uses the somatic rearrangements of
DE   variable leucine-rich cassettes in the variable lymphocyte receptors
DE   (VLRs). The hallmarks of an adaptive immune system is the production
DE   of antigen-specific recognition receptor by somatic gene
DE   rearrangement. The long life of some antigen-primed cytotoxic
DE   lymphocytes and plasma cells provide protective memory to prevent
DE   reinvasion.

ID   Chloride channel.
AC   KW-0869
DE   Protein which is part of an anion channel found in the plasma membrane
DE   and in intracellular membranes. These channels are permeable for
DE   various anions, such as iodide, bromide, but also for nitrates,
DE   phosphates and even negatively charged amino acids. They are called
DE   chloride channels, because chloride is the most abundant anion and the
DE   predominant permeating species in all organisms. They have been
DE   classified according to their gating mechanisms, which may depend on
DE   changes in the transmembrane electric field (voltage-dependent/gated
DE   chloride channels, e.g. ClC family), on a protein kinase/nucleotide
DE   mediated mechanism (CFTR), an increase in intracellular calcium
DE   (calcium activated chloride channels, e.g. CaCC), cell swelling
DE   (volume-regulated anion channels, e.g. VRAC) or binding of a ligand,
DE   e.g. glycine or - aminobutyric acid (GABA) activated channels. In
DE   contrast with cation channels, they are not involved in the initiation
DE   or spread of excitation, but in the regulation of excitability in
DE   nerve and muscle. They also participate in many housekeeping
DE   processes, such as volume regulation, pH regulation in organelles,
DE   electrogenesis and control of synaptic activity. The chloride channels
DE   are crucial for transepithelial transport and the control of water
DE   flow, and often provide unexpected permeation pathways for a large
DE   variety of anions.

DE   group of mechano-bullous disorders characterized by blistering and/or
DE   erosion of the skin and mucous membranes which occur spontaneously or
DE   as a result of mild physical trauma. Traditionally, epidermolysis
DE   bullosa is divided into three broad categories based on the level of

DE   separation is intraepidermal and occurs within the basal keratinocytes
DE   at the bottom layer of epidermis; the junctional forms (JEB) display
DE   tissue separation within the dermo-epidermal basement membrane
DE   (basement membrane zone, BMZ), primarily within the lamina lucida; in

DE   densa within the upper papillary dermis. Some forms of epidermolysis
DE   bullosa display tissue separation at the basal cell/lamina lucida
DE   interface, at the level of the hemidesmosomes (hemidesmosomal
DE   variants). The hemidesmosomal variants overlap with the traditional

DE   Protein involved in the synthesis or the attachment to a protein of a
DE   GPI-anchor (glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor) or a GPI-like-anchor
DE   (glycosylsphingolipidinositol anchor), both of which have complex
DE   oligoglycan linked to a phospholipidinositol molecule that serves to
DE   attach the C-terminus of some extracellular membrane proteins to the
DE   lipid bilayer of a membrane. The core glycolipid is composed of a
DE   tetraglycan: three mannose units and one glucosamine linked to a
DE   phospholipidinositol. The terminal mannose is linked to the protein
DE   via an ethanolamine attached to the C-terminal of the mature protein.
DE   The core structure is conserved from protozoa to humans. There are,
DE   however, marked differences in the glycosyl side chains attached to
DE   the core glycolipid. The phospholipid component may be either a
DE   phosphatide (two long chain fatty acids attached by ester linkage to
DE   glycerol phosphate) or a sphingolipid (a long chain fatty acid
DE   attached by amide linkage to a ceramide phosphate). Some yeast and
DE   Dictyosteliida synthesize the GPI-like anchor de novo, whereas other
DE   organisms may interconvert the lipid components by a "resculpting"
DE   process after the anchor is attached to the protein.

ID   Innate immunity.
AC   KW-0399
DE   Protein involved in innate immunity, an inborn defense mechanism used
DE   by organisms to defend themselves against invasion by pathogens
DE   (bacteria, fungi, viruses, etc.). Initially discovered in insects
DE   which are devoid of an adaptive immune system and rely only on innate
DE   immune reactions for their defense, this immediate response
DE   accomplishes many activities including recognition and effector
DE   functions. Recognition is mediated by broad specificity, pattern
DE   recognition, receptors which recognize many related molecular
DE   structures (e.g. polysaccharides, polynucleotides) present in
DE   microorganisms but not found in the host. The innate responses include
DE   the release of antimicrobial peptides, production of cytokines, acute-
DE   phase proteins, complement. Although many different innate immune
DE   mechanisms are deployed for host defence, a unifying theme of innate
DE   immunity is the use of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors
DE   for pathogens or damaged self components, such as the Toll-like
DE   receptors, nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-
DE   containing receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like RNA

DE   Protein that confers, on insect vectors and pests, the ability to

ID   RNA-mediated gene silencing.
AC   KW-0943
DE   Protein involved in RNA-mediated gene silencing. This term describes a
DE   number of related processes which use 21- to 25-nucleotide RNAs to
DE   repress the expression of specific target genes. These processes
DE   include the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA by either RNA
DE   interference (RNAi) or endogenously encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) and the
DE   transcriptional regulation of mRNA by RNAi-mediated chromatin
DE   silencing. RNAi is generally triggered by the presence of dsRNA
DE   produced by bidirectional transcription or by the transcription of an
DE   inverted repeat or hairpin sequence. dsRNA is processed into small
DE   interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of around 21 nucleotide which are then
DE   incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which
DE   cleaves mRNAs with sequences fully complementary to the siRNA. miRNAs
DE   differ from siRNAs principally in their biogenesis. miRNA genes encode
DE   precursors with complex hairpin structures which are processed by
DE   endonucleolytic cleavage to form mature miRNAs. Like siRNAs, miRNAs
DE   function in RISC-like complexes. Animal miRNAs generally inhibit
DE   translation of target mRNAs following imperfect base pairing to the
DE   3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), while most plant miRNAs show nearly
DE   precise complementarity to coding regions of target mRNAs and trigger
DE   mRNA degradation similar to siRNAs. Finally, in RNAi-mediated
DE   chromatin silencing, siRNAs derived from repeat element transcripts
DE   are incorporated into the nuclear RNAi-induced initiator of
DE   transcriptional silencing complex (RITS), where they guide chromatin
DE   modifications such as histone methylation which lead to
DE   transcriptional silencing.

ID   Viral receptor tropism switching.
AC   KW-1264
DE   A switch in the host range specificity occurs in some bacterial
DE   viruses through massive sequence variation of their host-binding
DE   receptor. Sequence variation can be induced by site-specific inversion
DE   of a DNA segment in their genome or by a diversity-generating
DE   retroelement. Inversion is catalyzed by a specific recombinase called
DE   invertase and consists of a reciprocal recombination event within two
DE   inverted repeats present in the viral genome that leads to the
DE   alternate expression of two different sets of genes involved in tail
DE   fiber biosynthesis. Mu-like viruses and P1-like viruses, for example,
DE   encode a recombinase responsible for the switch in the targeted host.
DE   Diversity-generating retroelements (DGR) like in BPP-1 virus also
DE   allow tropism switching by creating a mutant copy of an invariant DNA
DE   template repeat by transcription and reverse transcription and
DE   introducing this mutated sequence in the receptor-binding protein

AC   KW-1244
DE   Virion protein that constitutes the noncontractile ejection system
DE   carried by some short-tailed prokaryotic viruses such as some
DE   Podoviridae. This ejection system is composed at least of the tail
DE   tube and ejection proteins. Upon receptor binding, proteins located
DE   inside the capsid (head) rearrange to extend the tail tube, creating a
DE   channel spanning the periplasmic space. This hydrophilic channel
DE   directs the viral genome, and possibly some specific proteins, into
DE   the cytoplasm and protects it from periplasmic nucleases. Once the
DE   viral genome is in the host cytoplasm, the channel collapses and
DE   seals. Bacteriophage T7 for example expresses ejection proteins that
DE   partition into the host outer and cytoplasmic membranes and allow
