1) Uniprot data is downloaded using run_uniprot.bash for each proteome
   (other data was downloaded earlier)

2) CSV files for each proteoe is created using annotate_protein_fasta.py
   This crashes when files are missing  - had to rerun  (two files do crash on SEG, i.e are not annotated - deleted)


3) final CSV file is created using bin/create_final_dataset.py
  /But this needs to be modifies so that it makes one for all, one for unique Pfam etc...
