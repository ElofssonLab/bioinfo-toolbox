Trying to understand the pipeline..

To activate python

source /pfs/nobackup/home/w/wbasile/venv-work/bin/activate

Not clear with the start, but it all starts from groups of fast files.

Scripts

#run_iupred.py  (creates iupred annotations in results/uniprot_sequences_grops.
sbatch submit_run_iupred.bash


To rerun delete files *_annotate_
#python create_4_dataframes.py  This makes one anotations
sbatch submit_protein_annotation.bash



cat_all_results.sh  (merges all the results)

python format_pfam_datasets.py  creates the feather pickle (adding taxon id etc..)
			This is now updated to add number of proteins to the CSV file
			Needs to be run twice
