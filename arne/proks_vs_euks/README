Trying to understand the pipeline..


Not clear with the start, but it all starts from groups of fast files.

Scripts

run_iupred.py  (creates iupred annotations in results/uniprot_sequences_grops.
  (This is run by submit_protein_annotations.bash
  To retrun delete files *_annotate_
  
create_4_dataframes.py  This makes one anotations

cat_all_results.sh  (merges all the results)

format_pfam_datasets.py  creates the feather pickle (adding taxon id etc..)
			This is now updated to add number of proteins to the CSV file
			Needs to be run twice
