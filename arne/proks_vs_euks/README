Trying to understand the pipeline..



Scripts

create_4_dataframes.py  This makes one anotations
cat_all_results.sh  (merges all the results)
format_pfam_datasets.py  creates the feather pickle (adding taxon id etc..)
			This is now updated to dad number of proteins to the CSB
			Needs to be run twice
