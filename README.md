Some scripts I thought might be useful to the whole group.<br>
Most of it is still quite messy and/or rather quick'n'dirty.. so please go ahead and feel free to add/improve/document as much as you like!!
<br><br><br>
The following folders contain different python modules:<br><br>
<strong>alignment</strong> - dotter ported to python, detect overlapping sequences, plot large alignments<br>
<strong>contacts</strong> - plotting, network analysis on contact maps, different scoring methods, reformatting contacts to rosetta constraints, repeat filter, humble pconsc pipeline, sorting contacts<br>
<strong>hmmscan</strong> - repeat/multidomain analysis (quite messy)<br>
<strong>rosetta</strong> - fragment filtering, fix pdb numbering<br>
<strong>parsing</strong> - small parsers that have been useful in various occasions (most useful might be the pdb parser)
