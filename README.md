# Bioinfo Toolbox

Some scripts I thought might be useful to the Elofsson vrous group

Most of it is still quite messy and/or rather quick'n'dirty.. so
please go ahead and feel free to add/improve/document as much as you
like!!


The only restriction here is: if you want to adjust the input/output of a function, either use optional arguments or create a new definition of the function. Otherwise existing workflows might get disrupted.



# The following folders contain different python modules:

* alignment - dotter ported to python, detect overlapping sequences, plot large alignments
* contacts - plotting, network analysis on contact maps, different scoring methods, reformatting contacts to rosetta constraints, repeat filter, humble pconsc pipeline, sorting contacts
* hmmscan - repeat/multidomain analysis (quite messy)
* rosetta - fragment filtering, fix pdb numbering
* parsing- small parsers that have been useful in various occasions (most useful might be the pdb parser)
* trRosetta - Scripts for fold and Dock protocol
* Others - different scripts used by differen people
