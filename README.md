Some scripts I thought might be useful to the whole group.
Most of it is still quite messy and/or rather quick'n'dirty..


The following folders contain different python modules:

alignment - dotter ported to python, detect overlapping sequences, plot large alignments
contacts - plotting, network analysis on contact maps, different scoring methods, reformatting contacts to rosetta constraints, repeat filter, humble pconsc pipeline, sorting contacts
hmmscan - repeat/multidomain analysis (quite messy)
rosetta - fragment filtering, fix pdb numbering
parsing - small parsers that have been useful in various occasions (most useful might be the pdb parser)
