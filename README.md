Some scripts I thought might be useful to the whole group.<br>
Most of it is still quite messy and/or rather quick'n'dirty.. so please go ahead and feel free to add/improve/document as much as you like!!

The following folders contain different python modules:<br><br>
<ul>
<li><strong>alignment</strong> - dotter ported to python, detect overlapping sequences, plot large alignments</li>
<li><strong>contacts</strong> - plotting, network analysis on contact maps, different scoring methods, reformatting contacts to rosetta constraints, repeat filter, humble pconsc pipeline, sorting contacts</li>
<li><strong>hmmscan</strong> - repeat/multidomain analysis (quite messy)</li>
<li><strong>rosetta</strong> - fragment filtering, fix pdb numbering</li>
<li><strong>parsing</strong> - small parsers that have been useful in various occasions (most useful might be the pdb parser)</li>
</ul>
